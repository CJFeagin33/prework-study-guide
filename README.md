# prework-study-guide

## Description
This project encompasses a website that can be used as a study guide for the UC San Diego Extended Studies Coding Bootcamp Prework.

I was motivated to learn how to use different coding languages and understand the diffrences between them.

I built this project in order to take a hands-on approach in learning the different ways that HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript work, as well as how they all work together to create a finalized product.

Not only does the study guide act as a resource for academic review, but it also allows me to actually use the concepts that we have learned in the prework. 

Throughout this project I have been introduced to a variety of different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as been introduced to github and all it has to offer. I have also learned how to use the Command Line (Git Bash) in order to launch and connect all of my projects as one.

## Installation

I was required to install a variety of different progams, including Git Bash, Git CMD, and Git GUI, as well as Visual Studio. I also was required to create a github profile where I could store my projects as a repository.

## Usage

In order to use the study guide, open the website and review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome Dev tools (Control+Shift+I or right click anywhere on the page and press inspect) and read the suggestion at the bottom of the console menu.
